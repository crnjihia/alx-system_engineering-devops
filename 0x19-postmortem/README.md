# **Postmortem Report: The Case of the Mysterious 502 Gateway Error**

## **Issue Summary**

- **Outage Duration**: March 1, 2025, 14:30 - 15:45 (1 hour 15 minutes)
- **Impact**:
  - Our web application became completely inaccessible to all users.
  - Customers trying to access the platform were met with a **502 Bad Gateway** error.
  - **100% of users** were affected since the backend API was unreachable.
- **Root Cause**: A misconfigured Nginx reverse proxy update led to an incorrect upstream server configuration, breaking connectivity between the frontend and backend.

---

## **Timeline**

- **14:30** - Monitoring alerts triggered due to a **100% drop** in successful HTTP requests.
- **14:32** - Multiple users reported errors via customer support and Slack.
- **14:35** - Engineers began investigating the issue, suspecting a database failure.
- **14:50** - Database was confirmed to be **operating normally**.
- **15:00** - Focus shifted to API logs, revealing **no incoming requests**, leading to the assumption of a network issue.
- **15:10** - Nginx logs indicated repeated upstream connection failures.
- **15:20** - A rollback to the previous Nginx configuration was attempted, but failed due to an unrelated dependency issue.
- **15:35** - Engineers manually corrected the Nginx configuration and restarted the server.
- **15:45** - Service was fully restored.

## **Root Cause and Resolution**

### **Root Cause**

A recent deployment updated the Nginx configuration file but contained an incorrect upstream definition, causing requests to be misrouted. As a result:

- The frontend could not communicate with the backend API.
- All API calls resulted in **502 Bad Gateway** errors.
- The issue was not caught in staging due to insufficient testing.

### **Resolution**

- Engineers identified the configuration issue and **manually corrected the upstream settings**.
- The Nginx service was restarted to apply the changes.
- Once confirmed that the application was working, the changes were re-deployed with proper testing.

## **Corrective and Preventative Measures**

### **Improvements Needed**

- Improve **pre-deployment testing** to catch configuration issues before production releases.
- Implement **automated rollback mechanisms** for failed deployments.
- Enhance **monitoring alerts** to identify Nginx-specific failures faster.

### **Action Items**

✅ Add **automated configuration validation** in CI/CD pipeline.  
✅ Implement **a blue-green deployment strategy** to reduce downtime risks.  
✅ Increase **staging environment parity** with production.  
✅ Improve **documentation** on updating Nginx configurations safely.
